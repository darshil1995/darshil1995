👋 Hello, I'm Darshil Shah 

Machine Learning Engineer | Data Professional | Former Software Developer 
*Bridging the gap between high-performance data engineering and production-grade Machine Learning.*

I am an ML-focused professional with a **Software Engineering background** and a deep expertise in the end-to-end lifecycle of **AI/ML systems** from data ingestion and cleaning to real-time model deployment. My philosophy is that a model is only as good as its accessibility; I focus on building systems that are not just accurate, but maintainable, automated, and production-ready.

I specialize in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Predictive Modeling**, and **MLOps**, primarily within the **Python**, **AWS**, and **Azure** ecosystems.

## 🛠️ Technical Depth & Expertise

I manage the complete ML lifecycle: data engineering, feature engineering, model training, and API deployment.

| Area | Core Technologies | Deep Dive Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Machine Learning** | **Scikit-learn**, **NLP** (NLTK), **FastAPI**, **SynapseML**, Pandas, NumPy. | Building high-precision classifiers, **predictive modeling**, and deploying models as REST APIs for real-time inference. |
| **Data Engineering** | **AWS** (S3, Glue, Athena), **Azure** (Data Factory, Databricks), **PySpark**, Kafka. | Architecting **ML-ready data pipelines**, real-time streaming for feature stores, and automated ETL/ELT.
| **Analytics & BI** | **SQL**, Power BI, Tableau, EDA, Statistical Analysis. | Transforming model outputs into **actionable business strategy** and interactive performance dashboards.
| **Foundational** | Python, Java, Scala, Git, **CI/CD**, Agile. | Ensuring code quality, version control, and **continuous deployment** of software and ML models.
