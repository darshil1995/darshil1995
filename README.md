# üëã Hello, I'm Darshil Shah

Data Professional and former Software Developer with a **dual focus on building robust, scalable data infrastructure and transforming raw data into clear, quantifiable business strategy.** My background in software engineering allows me to design solutions that are not just analytical, but also maintainable, automated, and production-ready.

I specialize in both building robust data infrastructure and translating analytical insights into strategic recommendations. My expertise is primarily within **Python, SQL, PySpark,** and the **AWS, Azure, GCP, Databricks and Microsoft Fabric** cloud ecosystems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Depth & Expertise

I manage the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion and architecture design to final visualization and insight delivery.

| Area | Core Technologies | Deep Dive Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Engineering** | **AWS** (S3, Glue, Athena), **Azure** (Data Factory, Databricks), **Microsoft Fabric**, **GCP**, Apache Spark/PySpark, Delta Lake, Snowflake. | Building cloud-native **ETL/ELT pipelines**, data lake architecture, schema design, and query optimization for performance. |
| **Real-time Data** | **Kafka** (Redpanda), Streaming APIs. | Implementing **real-time streaming pipelines** and monitoring to ensure low-latency data availability for operational dashboards. |
| **Data Analysis & BI** | **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), **SQL**, Power BI, Tableau, Excel. | **Predictive modeling** (e.g., Random Forest), **Statistical analysis** (A/B testing, churn drivers), and **actionable business storytelling**. |
| **Foundational** | Python, Java, Scala, Git, CI/CD, Agile. | Developing and deploying data solutions with version control, testing, and continuous integration best practices. |
